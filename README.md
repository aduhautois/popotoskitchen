.NET II Programming Final Project

For our .NET II final project, we were instructed to create a program (Windows Forms or WPF) using ADO.NET to interact with a database. We were only required to have basic CRUD functionality to display our understanding of the subject material.

##What's Inside

A whole bunch of nifty tools for the Culinarian crafting class of FFXIV:HW (Final Fantasy 14 Online: Heavensward)!

  * ability to hire (create) cooks and manage them (CRUD)
  * customer management (CRUD)
  * basic order management (CRUD)
  * message sending and receiving between cooks
  * cook task management
  * recipe search
  * recipe ingredient search
  * stats calculator for raid food (recipes that customers would purchase)
  * archiving utilities for all records

It was a fun project and I learned a lot about C# and writing databases for programming by coding this project. I've learned a bit since then so my coding has improved but it remains a project that I am proud of! Every database interaction is performed by a stored procedure for security purposes.
